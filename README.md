# symmetry-restricted-exchange

Code developed for my MPhys project to automate symmetry analysis of magnetic exchange interactions in crystals, replacing manual tensor specialization using Neumann‚Äôs principle.

---

## Overview

This Python tool determines the symmetry-allowed form of exchange tensors between magnetic atoms in a crystal lattice. By analyzing the local bond symmetry (rather than the full space group), it automates the process of constraining tensor components based on Neumann‚Äôs principle ‚Äî a task typically done manually in theoretical magnetism research.

## Features

- Parses CIF files and extracts atomic structure
- Computes site symmetry groups for individual atoms
- Finds all bond vectors and groups symmetry-equivalent bonds
- Applies preserving/inverting symmetry operations to constrain a symbolic 3√ó3 exchange tensor
- Outputs specialized tensors grouped by bond length and symmetry

---

## Dependencies

You‚Äôll need Python 3.9+ and the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `sympy`
- `spglib`
- `pymatgen`

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy sympy spglib pymatgen

## üîç Example

### Input

Suppose you want to analyze the crystal structure in `Materials/Y3Fe5O12_symmetrised.cif` and examine the exchange tensors associated with atom 62 (the 63rd atom in the structure). Modify the bottom of the script like this:

```python
file_path = "Materials/Y3Fe5O12_symmetrised.cif"
atom_index = 62

lattice_vectors, atomic_fractional_coords, atomic_numbers = extract_cif_data(file_path)
overall_data = process_atoms(lattice_vectors, atomic_fractional_coords, atomic_numbers, lattice_size=0)

print(f"Specialized bond tensors for bonds connected to atom {atom_index}:")
print_grouped_bond_tensors(atom_index, overall_data)

Atom 62: Atomic number: 26, Cartesian coordinates: [3.216 2.955 1.750]
Site symmetry group: m-3m

Bond magnitude (Cartesian): 2.9821
  Symmetry-equivalent bond indices:
    Bond index: 15
    Bond endpoint atomic number: 26
    Bond endpoint fractional coordinates: [0.25 0.5  0.25]
    Bond endpoint Cartesian coordinates: [5.865 2.955 1.750]
    Specialized tensor:
‚é° Jxx   0    0  ‚é§
‚é¢  0   Jxx   0  ‚é•
‚é£  0    0   Jxx ‚é¶
